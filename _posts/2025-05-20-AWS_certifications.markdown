Welcome to my Qualifications & Certifications!

The first Certifications I have decided to work on are the AWS certifications!

AWS (Amazon Web Service) is a massive Cloud Computing platform catered towards individuals, businesses, and companies requiring servers, data centers, or otherwise.

Using their massive array of servers and software solutions, AWS can play an integral and even innovative part in most data/software oriented companies. For example, AWS can be used to: host static webpages; elastic services which can scale to meet incoming demands; or deploy redundant services to protect against downtime, maintenance, or even malicious attacks.

For these reasons, I have chosen to begin learning. To start with, I have taken the AWS Cloud Practitioner Training & Certification, to give myself a good idea of all the services AWS has to offer. After a few months of work, and accustomisation, I am proud to say I have finally managed to pass my Certification!
